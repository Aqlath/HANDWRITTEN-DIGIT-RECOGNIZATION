# HANDWRITTEN-DIGIT-RECOGNIZATION
# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN and Streamlit

This project demonstrates a deep learning-based handwritten digit recognition system built using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **Streamlit**. The model is trained on the **Kaggle MNIST CSV dataset** and deployed as a web application where users can upload an image and receive instant predictions.
